THINGS TO DO
============


1. Command Line Parsing
====================
Several scripts do manual parsing of command line options. THis needs to be
migrated to using the standard libray's parsing module optparse.



2. Using A Config File 
===================

I'd like to see it use a standrd ini file config file to set up standard
settings. Perhaps a command line switch to select among the configured servers


3. Meta option
==============
Add my --meta option to report on the script itself, depends on #2.
